"TableTennis" plugin by Stanislau Kurkou
Glasgow Caledonian University (2022)

This plugin was built in Visual Studio (2019) using JUCE library code. It implements a "ping-pong" stereo delay effect 
with the following user-defined controls:
-Delay Time for the left channel (up to 3000ms).
-Delay Time for the right channel (up to 3000ms).
-Feedback (0.0-0.99).
-Wet/Dry Delay mix (0.0-1.0).

This plugin facilitates the use of a generic UI via JUCE library code and allows for the user to retain their previous 
input settings when reopening a session.

TableTennis is designed for use as a VST3 plugin. Simply download and add the file path of "TableTennis.vst3" to the plugins 
folder for your DAW and re-scan. TableTennis has been tested using Reaper v6.50 (2022).

This project was completed as part of the Advanced Audio Processing module of the BSc (Hons) Audio Technology at Glasgow 
Caledonian University.
