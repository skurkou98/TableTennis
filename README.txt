"TableTennis" plugin by Stanislau Kurkou
Glasgow Caledonian University (2022)

This plugin was built in Visual Studio (2019) using JUCE library code. It implements a "ping-pong" stereo delay effect 
with the following user-defined controls:
-Delay Time for the left channel (up to 3000ms).
-Delay Time for the right channel (up to 3000ms).
-Feedback (0.0-0.99).
-Wet/Dry Delay mix (0.0-1.0).

It facilitates the use of the Generic Audio Processor Editor available in JUCE for the User Interface.

This project was completed as part of the Advanced Audio Processing module of the BSc (Hons) Audio Technology at Glasgow 
Caledonian University.

It has been designed for use as a VST3 plugin and can be tested in Reaper using both mono or stereo audio files.
